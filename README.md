This has been burning a hole in my drive for far too long, so I'm just going to make it publicly available so I can get feedback on it.
I think mechanically everything is implemented at this point, even if some of it may still be slightly placeholder.
Changes will be made, some may be drastic, and some may cause issues if the mod is updated mid-save.
Balance is uhhh. Some of the stuff will probably be very weak, some too strong.
There's no mod settings yet. I'd like to get the default values sorted out before I add that.

As for getting a lycanthrope:
-  Have a pawn get mauled by feral werewolves
- Have a pawn drink a wolfsblood elixir
- If you have Biotech, there's the `lycanthrope blood` archite gene

If you're wanting to speed things up a bit:
- Directly add any of the following hediffs to the pawn: 
  - `Mashed_Bloodmoon_SaniesLupinus`
  - `Mashed_Bloodmoon_LycanthropeDormant`
  - `Mashed_Bloodmoon_Lycanthrope`
- Directly spawn in `Mashed_Bloodmoon_PotionWolfsblood`
- Create a xenotype during startup that has the `lycanthrope blood` archite gene
  - Or directly add the `Mashed_Bloodmoon_LycanthropeBlood` gene using dev mode
