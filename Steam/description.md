A completely remade version of the original MorrowRim - Bloodmoon mod, made to a much higher standard, and with significantly more experience under my belt. There is now a fully featured, customisable, and upgradeable, lycanthropy system included.

[quote] The glow of a blood red moon has awoken something ancient from a deep slumber. The call of The Huntsman can be heard echoing through the eerie silence. The air itself carries the unmistakable scent of blood. Ominous howling can be heard in the distance, growing ever closer. [/quote]

Roughly every 30 days the Huntsman's Moon will rise, covering the world in an eerie red glow. During this time packs of feral werewolves will attack settlements, and ambush caravans. These feral werewolves can spread a disease called Sanies Lupinus, which if left untreated will eventually transition into dormant lycanthropy. Upon the next Huntsman's Moon the infected will experience their first transformation.

The time between attacks, and the strength of attacks, can be modified in the mod settings menu.

[quote] A fully fledged lycanthrope, now able to transform into their beast form at will. While the Huntsman's blood offers little benefit outside of beast form, it does provide immunity to certain infections. [/quote]

Once a lycanthrope has recovered from their first transformation, they gain the ability to transform at will, as well as upgrade and customise their beast form. While most of the bonuses, and downsides, are only active in beast form, some are active in human form as well:

[list]
[*]They are immune to several diseases, and have a lesser risk of getting food poisoning.

[*]They take additional damage from weapons made out of silver, and gain a negative mood if wearing anything made out of silver.

[*]They always struggle to get a good nights sleep. They gain no mood bonuses for sleeping in impressive bedrooms or barracks, and instead will always gain a mood debuff after sleep.
[/list]

[quote] A lycanthrope transformed into their beastial form, greatly empowering them, though at a cost. Transformed lycanthropes are unable to do any form of work, and their vocal cords have become too malformed for speech. [/quote]

The true nature of lycanthropes comes out when they are in their beast form. Amplifying their downsides, but granting full access to their bonuses.

[list]
[*]They are completely incapable of work and speech.

[*]They can eat corpses and raw food without any negative effects.

[*]They are unable to use weapons, but have powerful claws and fangs.

[*]Overall increased durability and wound healing, but more susceptible to fire, toxins and silver.

[quote] Lycanthropic stress will gradually build up while in their beastial form. If this ever reaches its limit, the lycanthrope will enter an uncontrollable fury. [/quote]

A lycanthropes beast form can only be maintained for so long, as stress will build up while transformed. Stress is converted into fatigue once the transformation ends, preventing another transformation until the lycanthrope has recovered. 

If a lycanthrope builds up too much stress while transformed they will enter an uncontrolable fury, prolonging the transformation, but causing them to hunt down [b]anything[/b] that moves.

How much stress a lycanthrope can withstand can be increased through eating the hearts of fresh corpses, and downed pawns using the Consume Heart ability.
